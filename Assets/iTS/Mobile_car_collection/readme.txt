This is the mobile-version of our car-collection.
The collection contains 18 different low-poly cars.

All car-meshes are using only 1 material. The main
car body can be colored by the user using a simple
script. A special shader for the main-color change
is also included.

To use them, just drag the prefab into your scene
and just the "Car-Color-Script" to change to color 
of your car.
The script is used for the reason, to put one 
and the same car more than one time into your scene
and give them all different colors without adding
new materials.

All wheels are single objects parented to the cars to
make it easy to animate them or use them with physic-setups.

Just open the example scene for a simple preview.
